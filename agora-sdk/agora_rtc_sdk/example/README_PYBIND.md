### Documentation for Integrating Agora SDK with Python Using PyBind11

#### Overview
This documentation outlines the process of integrating the Agora Linux C++ SDK with Python using PyBind11, facilitating the sending of PCM audio data. It includes setting up the C++ environment, configuring PyBind11, and implementing Python bindings to utilize the shared object files in Python scripts.

#### Requirements
- Agora Linux C++ SDK
- PyBind11
- Python 3.x
- CMake
- A Linux development environment

### Setup Reference

#### https://docs.agora.io/en/server-gateway/get-started/integrate-sdk?platform=linux-cpp

#### Setup and Configuration

##### 1. Download and Prepare Agora SDK
- Download the Agora Linux C++ SDK.
- Extract the SDK and navigate to the `examples` directory. This directory contains various example projects and a `build.sh` script used for building the examples.

##### 2. Setting Up the Sample Audio Folder
- Within the `examples` directory, create a new folder named `sample_pybinds`.
- Copy the `send_audio` example and the `CMakeLists.txt` file from another component into the `sample_pybinds` folder.

##### 3. Integrating PyBind11
- Clone the PyBind11 repository into the `extern/PyBind11` directory:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git extern/
  ```
- Modify the `CMakeLists.txt` in the `sample_pybinds` folder to include the PyBind11 library. This setup will not produce a `.out` file but a `.so` (shared object) file which can be imported in Python.

##### 4. Building the Project
- Run the `build.sh` script from the `examples` directory to compile all examples, which includes the custom `sample_pybinds` project.
- Ensure the `CMakeLists.txt` at the root of the examples directory is properly set up to include necessary Agora API headers and the PyBind11 configuration.

##### 5. Python Binding with PyBind11
- In the `sample_pybinds` directory, create a new C++ file (`pybind_audio.cpp`) that includes the PyBind bindings for the Agora functionalities. Define a PyBind class with methods corresponding to:
  - Service Initialization
  - Connection to a meeting
  - Audio Manager creation
  - Sending audio frames
- Ensure that Agora's essential parameters (app ID, token, channel name, and user ID) are handled correctly. Note: The user ID should be numeric; textual IDs will not throw an error but will prevent data transmission.

##### 6. Compilation and Usage of the Shared Object File
- Compile the modified project to generate a `.so` file.
- Use this file in Python scripts by importing the custom module created with PyBind11.

##### 7. Python Implementation
- Implement a Python script (`send_audio.py`) that uses the shared object file to create a service instance and connect using the provided channel ID and token.
- The script should handle PCM data, sending it frame-by-frame in 10-millisecond chunks. Manage timing accurately to ensure frames are sent exactly at 10-millisecond intervals.

##### 8. Advanced Features and Stress Testing
- Implement threading in the Python script to continuously read and send audio data.
- Plan and execute stress tests for both audio sending and receiving capabilities.
- Extend functionalities to include video streaming.

#### Documentation Links and References
- Insert the link to Agora's official documentation for basic package installations and detailed SDK instructions.
- Placeholder for additional relevant links and resources.

#### Future Enhancements
- Optimize the timing mechanism for sending audio frames to accommodate processing delays effectively.
- Expand the capabilities to include robust video handling and receiving audio streams.

#### File and Code Snippets
- Add relevant code snippets and file structures as needed to illustrate the setup and usage.

### Notes
- Ensure all placeholders are filled with appropriate links and actual data before finalizing the documentation.
- Verify all steps by building and running the project in a controlled environment to ensure reliability and accuracy of the documentation.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for integrating the Agora SDK with Python, focusing primarily on audio functionalities but with insights into potential expansions for full multimedia handling.
